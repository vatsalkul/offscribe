## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- üçé **macOS 13+** (Apple Silicon recommended)
- üêç **Python 3.8+**
- üé§ **Microphone access**


## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/offscribe.git
cd offscribe

python3 -m venv transcriber
source transcriber/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

1. Activate your virtual environment (if not already active):
```bash
source transcriber/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

2. Start the application:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

3. **Grant accessibility permissions** when prompted:
   - **Required for keyboard monitoring and auto-paste functionality**
   - You'll need to add your terminal app (Terminal, iTerm2, etc.) to accessibility permissions
   - **For VS Code users**: Also add VS Code to accessibility permissions for seamless pasting
   - Go to: System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility

4. Use the transcriptor:
   - Click on any text field where you want to transcribe
   - **Double-click Left Ctrl** to start recording (you'll hear a "Pop" sound)
   - Speak clearly into your microphone
   - **Double-click Left Ctrl** again to stop recording (you'll hear a "Blow" sound)
   - Wait for transcription (you'll hear a "Glass" sound when complete)
   - The transcribed text will be automatically pasted into your text field

### Alternative Mode (No Accessibility Permissions)

If you prefer not to grant accessibility permissions, the app will run in simple mode:
- Type `s` and press Enter to start recording
- Type `q` and press Enter to stop recording
- The transcribed text will be copied to your clipboard

## How It Works

1. **Audio Capture**: Records audio at 16kHz using your default microphone
2. **Local Processing**: Uses MLX Whisper (large-v3-turbo) model for transcription
3. **Smart Integration**: Automatically pastes transcribed text into the active application
4. **Feedback System**: Provides audio cues for each stage of the process

## Audio Feedback Sounds

- üîµ **Pop**: Recording started
- üå¨Ô∏è **Blow**: Recording stopped
- ü•Ç **Glass**: Transcription successful
- üì¢ **Basso**: Error occurred

## Troubleshooting

### Accessibility Permissions
If the hotkeys aren't working or auto-paste isn't functioning:
1. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
2. Add the following apps to the allowed list:
   - **Terminal** (or iTerm2, Warp, etc. - whatever you're running Python from)
   - **VS Code** (if you're coding - essential for pasting transcribed text)
   - **Any other apps** where you want to use transcription
3. **Important**: You may need to toggle the permissions off and back on
4. Restart the application after granting permissions

**Note**: Without accessibility permissions, the app will fall back to simple clipboard mode (no auto-paste).

### Audio Issues
- Ensure your microphone is properly connected
- Check System Settings > Sound > Input to verify your microphone is selected
- The app uses your system's default audio input device

### Performance
- First transcription may be slower as the model loads
- Subsequent transcriptions will be faster
- For best performance, use an Apple Silicon Mac

## Configuration

Currently, the application uses default settings optimized for general use:
- Model: `mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo`
- Sample Rate: 16kHz
- Auto-paste: Enabled
- Hotkey: Double-click Left Ctrl

## Privacy

This application is completely offline:
- No internet connection required
- Audio is processed locally on your device
- No data is sent to external servers
- Temporary audio files are automatically deleted after transcription
